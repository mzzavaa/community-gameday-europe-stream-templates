# 3. Gameplay — `3-GameDayStreamGameplay.tsx`

## Overview

The Gameplay composition is the **muted overlay** that displays during the 2-hour competitive game (18:30–20:30 event time). The stream audio is muted — teams are playing the AWS GameDay challenges at their local User Group locations.

This composition is intentionally minimal. Its job is to:
- Show a countdown to game end
- Indicate the current gameplay quarter
- Warn teams when time is running low
- Alert everyone to prepare speakers for the closing ceremony

## What Attendees See

For most of the 2 hours, the screen shows:

1. A **Time Left** countdown (top-right, compact GlassCard) counting down from 120:00
2. A **Phase Indicator** (bottom-left) showing the current quarter (e.g., "Hour 1 — Q2")
3. An **Audio Badge** showing "MUTED"
4. The background with minimal darkening (0.25) so it feels lighter than other compositions

### Final 30 Minutes (Frame 162000+)

- The countdown label stays "Time Left" but the timer color shifts to **GD_ORANGE**
- A **"Final 30 Minutes"** text appears bottom-right with a subtle pulse
- The timer gets a gentle scale pulse (1.0 → 1.04 → 1.0)

### Final 5 Minutes (Frame 207000+)

- The countdown shifts to **GD_PINK** with an urgency glow
- The label changes to **"Almost Done!"**
- A pulsing pink box-shadow creates visual urgency
- An **Audio Cue Banner** appears at the top: "Audio will be needed for Closing Ceremony — Prepare your speakers"

### Exported Helper Functions

These are exported for property-based testing:

```typescript
// Audio cue banner visible in final 5 minutes
export function isGameplayAudioCueBannerVisible(frame: number): boolean {
  return frame >= 207000;
}

// Final 30 minutes — orange urgency
export function isFinal30MinutesActive(frame: number): boolean {
  return frame >= 162000;
}

// Final 5 minutes — pink urgency glow
export function isUrgencyGlowActive(frame: number): boolean {
  return frame >= 207000;
}
```

### Layer Stack

| Layer | Element | Position | Visible |
|-------|---------|----------|---------|
| 1 | BackgroundLayer (darken 0.25) | Full screen | Always |
| 2 | AudioBadge (muted) | Bottom-right | Always |
| 3 | Time Left Countdown | Top-right | Always |
| 4 | Phase Indicator | Bottom-left | Always |
| 5 | "Final 30 Minutes" text | Bottom-right | Frame ≥ 162000 |
| 6 | Audio Cue Banner | Top center | Frame ≥ 207000 |

## Design Decisions

- **Minimal overlay** — Teams are focused on their AWS consoles, not the stream. The overlay should be unobtrusive.
- **Light background** — Only 25% darkening (vs 60–70% in other compositions) to feel less heavy during the long gameplay period.
- **No sidebar** — No schedule needed during gameplay. Just the timer and phase.
- **Progressive urgency** — Visual intensity increases gradually: normal → orange (30 min) → pink glow (5 min) to naturally draw attention as time runs out.
- **Audio cue** — Critical reminder since the closing ceremony requires audio and teams may have disconnected speakers.

## Key Gameplay Moments

| Time (CET) | Frame | What Happens |
|-------------|-------|-------------|
| 19:30 | 108000 | Half-time — leaderboard shown, QR code for self-check |
| 19:45–20:00 | 135000–162000 | Survey quest unhidden (5000 bonus points) |
| 20:00 | 162000 | Final 30 minutes — orange urgency begins |
| 20:25 | 207000 | Final 5 minutes — pink urgency glow + audio cue banner |
| 20:30 | 216000 | Game ends |

All information during gameplay is visual only — no voice communication from the stream during this phase. The leaderboard will be shown periodically, and a QR code is provided so attendees can check it on their own devices.
