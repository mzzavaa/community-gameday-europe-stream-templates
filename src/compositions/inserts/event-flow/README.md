# Inserts: Event Flow

Phase markers and timing anchors. Use these to mark the major transitions in the event. They set the rhythm of the broadcast.

| Insert ID | When to use | Update |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| `Insert-QuestsLive` | The moment quests become accessible — the kickoff | Nothing |
| `Insert-HalfTime` | At the 60-minute mark | Nothing |
| `Insert-FinalCountdown` | Last 15–30 minutes warning | `MINUTES_REMAINING` |
| `Insert-GameExtended` | Extra time added to the game | `EXTRA_MINUTES` |
| `Insert-LeaderboardHidden` | When scores go dark for the final stretch | Nothing |
| `Insert-ScoresCalculating` | After gameplay ends, while results are being tallied | Nothing |
| `Insert-BreakAnnouncement` | Any short pause in the stream | Nothing |
| `Insert-WelcomeBack` | Returning from a break (pair with BreakAnnouncement) | Nothing |

**Color:** Gold (`GD_GOLD`) for most — neutral timing events. Orange (`GD_ORANGE`) for QuestsLive — AWS platform activating. Violet (`GD_VIOLET`) for break-related — community context.
